Amethyst License
Last Updated: March 23, 2025

This license has been created by Amethyst Group ("Amethyst") to establish the terms and conditions governing the use, distribution, and modification of all Minecraft modifications (collectively with all updates thereof and versions thereof, the "Mods") created by Amethyst. Amethyst is making the Mods available under the terms stated herein.

This permission does not constitute any license or transfer of rights in and to the Mods or their underlying code. You may not copy, fork, reproduce, modify, sell, license, distribute, commercialize, or otherwise exploit, or create derivative works based upon, the Mods or their underlying code, all of which is reserved by Amethyst. Amethyst reserves the right to revoke this permission at any time, for any reason (including, without limitation, in the event of its violation), though any failure or delay by Amethyst in exercising any of its rights or remedies, in whole or in part, under applicable law or this permission in any instance will not be deemed to be a waiver of those rights or remedies in that instance or any other instance.

THE MODS ARE PROVIDED TO YOU “AS IS” AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE, ALL OF WHICH ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. AMETHYST MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND THAT THE MODS WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, BE COMPATIBLE OR WORK WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS, OR SERVICES, OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, MEET ANY PERFORMANCE OR RELIABILITY STANDARDS, OR BE ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ANY ERRORS OR DEFECTS CAN OR WILL BE CORRECTED.

Attribution, Acknowledgment, and Integrity of Origin:

You are obligated to provide clear, prominent, and persistent attribution to the original creators of the Mods. This attribution must be readily visible and accessible to end-users.

Attribution must include a direct, functional link to the official Modrinth project page or the primary repository from which the Mods were obtained, ensuring users can easily access the original source.

Any redistribution of the Mods, whether in their original form or in a permitted modified form, must be accompanied by a readily accessible notice that explicitly details all modifications made to the original work. This notice should be clear and understandable to non-technical users.

You are strictly prohibited from misrepresenting the origin of the Mods, falsely implying endorsement by the original creators, or altering the Mods' integrity in a manner that could mislead users or damage the Mods' reputation.

Non-Commercial Use and Prohibited Commercial Activities:

The Mods are provided for non-commercial use exclusively. Commercial use, in any form, is strictly prohibited without explicit, written consent from Amethyst.

Commercial use includes, but is not limited to:

Selling, licensing, or otherwise distributing the Mods or any derivative works, including compiled binaries, source code, or assets, for monetary gain, whether directly or indirectly.

Integrating the Mods into server services, platforms, or applications that charge for access, features, or subscriptions, regardless of the payment model.

Using the Mods as a promotional tool, advertisement, or endorsement for any commercial products, services, or brands, even if the Mods themselves are not sold.

Accepting donations, sponsorships, or other forms of compensation in exchange for access to the Mods or services related to the Mods' use, where such compensation is tied to the Mods' distribution or availability.

Any other activity that generates revenue or commercial benefit from the Mods or their derivatives, including but not limited to, using the Mods to drive traffic to commercial websites or services.

Prohibition of Derivative Works and Modifications to Preserve Integrity:

You are expressly prohibited from creating or distributing derivative works, modifications, or adaptations of the Mods, except as explicitly permitted by Amethyst in writing.

Derivative works include, but are not limited to:

Alterations to the Mods' source code, assets, textures, sounds, or configuration files.

Addons, extensions, plugins, or patches that modify or extend the Mods' functionality.

Compilations, bundles, or distributions that include the Mods with other modifications or content, even if the Mods themselves are not altered.

Reinterpretations or recreations of the Mods' features or content in other forms or media, including but not limited to, remakes or reimplementations.

This prohibition is in place to preserve the Mods' integrity, ensure consistent user experience, and prevent the distribution of potentially harmful or incompatible modifications.

Distribution, Redistribution, and Integrity Preservation:

You may distribute or redistribute the original, unmodified Mods files, provided that you adhere to the attribution and acknowledgment requirements outlined above.

Please contact us VIA our discord account amethystgroup, or for more urgent messages, contact our owner, gamerbenyt if you believe that any distributed version of the Mods does not match the official version of the Mods as produced by this repository so that we can resolve any discrepancies and ensure community trust in Amethyst's products and services.
