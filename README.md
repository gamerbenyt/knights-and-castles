### About The NF Releases
The New Neoforge Releases Are Just Ports, Not New Modloaders For This Mod. New Versions Will Still Be Released With FML But We Expanded Our Compatibility With Other Mods By Porting KC to NeoForge! We May Eventually Switch To Neoforge In The Future But For Now, Its Just A Second Modloader Version Of KC.
